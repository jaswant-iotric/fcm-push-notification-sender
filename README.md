This android project can be used to test FCM integration. You can send push notifications to your apps using FCM on android/iOS. 
======

###How to use?

1. Insert your server key
2. Insert notification title
3. Insert sssasnotification messages
4. Choose whether you want to send push to a topic or a device token
5. Enter your topic name/device token (Based on what you chose above).
6. Press send to send push notification.

Whats next?
1. Ability to parse correct error message from FCM response.
2. Show loader when API called. 
3. Option to store sent notifications as templates and reuse them.
4. Add ability to send non notification messages (i.e. Data messages).
5. Add ability to choose notification sound.

This repository is open for any PRs that improves it. I tried to find a similar source code that is very simple and doesnt contain a lot of complex things. Can be very useful for testers and developers to test push notification integration.
